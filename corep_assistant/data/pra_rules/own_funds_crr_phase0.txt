PRA Rulebook – Own Funds (CRR)
Phase 0: Conceptual and Reporting-Level Summary
(Supporting COREP Template C 01.00 – Own Funds)

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose of Own Funds

Own funds represent the capital resources of an institution that are available to absorb losses and protect depositors, creditors, and the stability of the financial system.

Regulatory capital must be:
- Loss absorbing
- Permanently or conditionally available
- Genuinely funded by investors
- Reliable in periods of financial stress

These principles underpin prudential supervision and COREP reporting.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. Composition of Own Funds

Own funds consist of the following components:

- Tier 1 Capital
- Tier 2 Capital

Tier 1 Capital is further divided into:
- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
- Additional Tier 1 (AT1)

This structure reflects the relative quality and loss-absorbing capacity of capital.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. Tier 1 Capital

Tier 1 capital represents going-concern capital and absorbs losses while an institution remains operational.

Tier 1 capital consists of the sum of:
- Common Equity Tier 1 capital
- Additional Tier 1 capital

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital

Common Equity Tier 1 capital is the highest quality form of regulatory capital.

Key characteristics:
- Absorbs losses first
- Is permanent and fully available
- Provides the strongest protection to creditors

CET1 capital includes, at a high level:
- Ordinary shares
- Retained earnings
- Reserves and accumulated income

For COREP purposes, CET1 is reported as an aggregate amount.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital

Additional Tier 1 capital consists of eligible capital instruments that absorb losses while the institution remains a going concern.

Key characteristics:
- Subordinate to CET1
- Includes contractual loss absorption mechanisms
- May be written down or converted when capital levels fall

AT1 instruments provide an additional buffer above CET1.

----------------------------------------------------------------

6. Tier 2 Capital

Tier 2 capital represents gone-concern capital.

Key characteristics:
- Absorbs losses in resolution or insolvency
- Is subordinate to Tier 1 capital
- Provides protection once CET1 and AT1 are exhausted

Tier 2 capital contributes to total own funds but is lower quality than Tier 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------

7. Capital Hierarchy and Loss Absorption Order

Capital instruments are organised in a strict hierarchy based on loss-absorbing capacity:

1. Common Equity Tier 1 (first to absorb losses)
2. Additional Tier 1
3. Tier 2 (last to absorb losses)

This hierarchy is fundamental to prudential regulation and COREP aggregation logic.

----------------------------------------------------------------

8. Reporting Perspective (COREP Context)

COREP Own Funds reporting focuses on:
- Aggregated capital categories (CET1, AT1, Tier 2)
- Clear reconciliation between components
- Accurate calculation of total own funds

Instrument-level eligibility tests, transitional arrangements, and detailed deductions are outside the scope of this conceptual summary and are addressed in more detailed regulatory provisions.
